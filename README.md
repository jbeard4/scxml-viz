** We have developed a new SCXML visualization library: [https://github.com/JacobeanRnD/SCHVIZ](SCHVIZ) **

A d3-based library for visualizing SCXML with SVG.

See [scion-web-simulation-environment/viz](https://github.com/jbeard4/scion-web-simulation-environment/tree/viz) for an example of how scxml-viz may be used.
